# Frontier-Space
A scifi game set on a colony ship traveling through space. Inspired by games like Half-Life and Halo.

If you clone this repository, and the main menu/intro cinematic skyboxes aren't rendering correctly, that's because it's missing this skybox asset:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333
I didn't add this to the git because I would have had to use Git LFS to push it here, and ain't nobody got time for that.
